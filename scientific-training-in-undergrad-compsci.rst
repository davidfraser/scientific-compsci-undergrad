Scientific Training in Undergraduate Computer Science
=====================================================

Background
----------

This document was formed out of the consensus of leaders in software development companies in Cape Town,
and proposes some changes to the undergraduate Computer Science curriculum,
in order to improve the level of understanding and effectiveness of students,
both in order to increase their relevant skills on graduation,
and in order to improve the rate at which they develop as software engineers during their studies.

Rationale
---------

.. epigraph::

   *Science* is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of 
   testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

   -- `Wikipedia article on Science <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science>`_.

In the experience of the undersigned,
the combined practice of source code control and intelligently managed testing
enable a software developer to engage in the process of software development scientifically.

Source Control
--------------

Source control systems minimally enable developers to:

* Determine accurately what changes they have made while working on code
* Record the history of changes made to code, and the reasons for those changes
* Work effectively with others on code without unneccessary manual work on merging changes
* Organize particular tasks into groups of changes

Without source control, it is possible to work on code from day to day,
with no clear awareness of what code one has changed,
which amounts to moving from an unknown state to another unknown state.

We are not aware of any effective software development teams that do not use modern source control systems.
They have become part of the minimal tools of a software developer.
These systems are relatively easy to learn, and would improve the self-management of students
even when working on simple projects during the course of their studies.

We believe that using Source Control systems alone
would actually increase the amount of time available to students over the course of their studies
by increasing their efficiency in project work.

Testing
-------

Testing is obviously a broad subject, encompassing a whole range of approaches.

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a practice which ensure engineering rigour when coding,
and has positive effects on the design of code, and the understanding of what coding is.

While we do not all practice TDD universally, we feel that the experience of developing
that TDD gives can transform individuals understanding of testing and the role that it
plays in development.

Proposal
--------

We would like to take part in discussions with the University
towards determining appropriate ways to develop students in the above areas
during the course of their undergraduate studies.

We recognize that curriculum development requires a careful balance,
but firmly believe that these matters are a crucial part of the training
of a computer scientist.

We also make ourselves available to take part in inputting students
as part of the formal curriculum
(as we have been doing informally)
in order to support this change.
